An Optimal Strategy of Donation for Educational Purpose

summary

In order to determine the optimal donation strategy, this paper proposes a data- motivated model based on an original definition of return on investment (ROI)
appropriate for charitable organizations.

First, we process and clean the data. In this process, we extract the required data and use the clustered mean to fill in the missing data.

Secondly, in order to solve the problems caused by high-dimensional data, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the data and obtain new feature vectors, that is, new performance indicators.

Next, we developed a composite index called the Performance Index to quantify the student's educational performance. The performance index is a linear combination of the performance indicators analyzed by the PCA in the previous step, and the coefficients are obtained by stepwise fitting through the cyclic neural network (CNN).

Finally, we calculate ROI, defined as increase in performance index over in- crease in donation amount. This ROI is institution-specific and dependent on in- crease in donation amount. By adopting a two-step ROI maximization algorithm, we determine the optimal investment strategy.



​			A Letter to the CFO of the Goodgrant Foundation

Dear Chiang,

Our team has developed a performance metric that quantifies the educational performance of each of the student's institutions and appropriately defines the return on investment (ROI) for charities such as the Goodgrant Foundation. Mathematical models are built to help predict return on investment after determining the mechanism by which donations affect performance.

The optimal investment strategy is determined by maximizing the estimated return on investment. More specifically, the Composite Performance Index is developed after considering all possible performance indicators, such as graduation rates and graduate income. The performance index is built to represent the performance of the school and the positive impact the school has on students and the community. From this perspective, our definition seeks to capture the social benefits of donations. Then we use principal component analysis to find performance contribution variables that strongly influence performance metrics. We fit the relationship between these variables and the donation amount to predict the change in the value of each performance contribution variable relative to the donation amount. We calculate the ROI (defined as the increase in performance indicators relative to the amount of donations) by multiplying the value of each performance contribution variable by the amount of the donation and the impact of each performance contribution variable on the performance index, and then adding the products for all performances. Contribution variable. After maximizing the return on investment based on the selection algorithm, the optimal investment strategy is determined.

In summary, our model successfully developed an investment strategy that included a list of target institutions and the amount of investment for each institution. (The list for the first year is attached to the end of the letter). The duration of the investment can also be determined based on our model. Since the model and assessment method are completely data-driven and do not contain any standards, it is suitable for solving future philanthropic education investment issues. We firmly believe that our model can effectively improve the efficiency of philate education investment and provide an appropriate and feasible way to best improve students' educational performance.
